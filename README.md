# SAP Integration Strategies: Architecture, SAP HANA, and Real-World Use Cases

## 📘 Overview
This repository accompanies the graduate-level research paper titled:  
**“An Introduction to SAP and SAP HANA: Architecture, Capabilities, and Integration Strategies for Modern Enterprise Systems”**

It includes:
- A 30-page research paper with diagrams and references.
- An in-class, no-cost practical assignment designed to reinforce key integration concepts.
- Optional code samples and system architecture visualizations.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand the evolution and modular architecture of SAP ERP and SAP S/4HANA.
- Explore the design of SAP HANA and in-memory computing.
- Analyze SAP’s integration capabilities: EDI, APIs (OData/REST), and message queues (PI/PO, CPI, Kafka).
- Examine security, compliance, and governance in SAP system integration.
- Discuss future trends such as AI, RPA, microservices, and event-driven architecture.

## 📁 Repository Contents
| File/Folder | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `/report/` | Contains the full APA-formatted research paper (PDF or DOCX) |
